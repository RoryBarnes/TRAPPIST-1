VPLanet Modeling of the TRAPPIST-1 Planetary System
============

This repo contains files and scripts to simulate the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system with [VPLanet](https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplanet>). To generate the figures, you must compile VPLanet and place the executable in your path. You must also install [vplot](https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplot). 

Directories
